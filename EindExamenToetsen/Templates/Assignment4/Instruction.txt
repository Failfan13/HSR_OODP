You are tasked with implementing a program that manages a library's book inventory. The program should allow users to add books, search for books by genre, remove books from the inventory, and undo a removed book in order.

BookCategory
Create a public enum called BookCategory in BookCategory.cs with the following two categories: Children and Adult.

Book
Modify class Book in Book.cs:

Add property Category of type BookCategory.
Adjust the constructor accordingly to set this value.
Library
Create the Library class in Library.cs with two fields:

A Dictionary called BookInventory to store the books. The book title should be the key, and the book object should be the value.
A Stack called RemovedBooks to keep track of the books (objects) that are removed from the inventory.
Hint: don't forget to initialize these two fields.
This class has the following methods:

AddBook: takes the title, author, genre and the BookCategory. Creates a Book object and adds it to the BookInventory dictionary.
SearchByGenre takes a genre and returns a list of books from the BookInventory dictionary that match this genre. (You could use a LINQ where statement).
RemoveBook takes a book title. If a book with this title exists in the inventory, it is removed from the dictionary and added to the RemovedBooks stack.
Implement a method called UndoRemove that adds the last removed book back to the inventory.
