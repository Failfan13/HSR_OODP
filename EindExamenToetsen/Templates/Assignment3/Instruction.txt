We have provided you with the class Animal and the static class AnimalHierachy. The latter has the static method PrintAnimalHierarchy, which should call the method PrintAnimalNames.

PrintAnimalHierarchy
Complete the method PrintAnimalHierarchy, so that it calls PrintAnimalNames correctly.

PrintAnimalNames
This static method takes an Animal object and a lambda expression (Action). It recursively prints the names of the animals and their children, using the lambda expression as the print action.

The lambda expression (Action) takes an object of class Animal, prints its name to the console, and returns nothing.
For example:

Animal lion = new Animal("Lion", new List<Animal>
{
    new Animal("Cub 1", null),
    new Animal("Cub 2", null)
});

Animal elephant = new Animal("Elephant", new List<Animal>
{
    new Animal("Calf 1", null),
    new Animal("Calf 2", new List<Animal>
    {
        new Animal("Calf 2.1", null),
        new Animal("Calf 2.2", null)
    })
});

Animal zoo = new Animal("Zoo", new List<Animal>
{
    lion,
    elephant
});

AnimalHierarchy.PrintAnimalHierarchy(zoo);
The above code should result in the following console output:

Animal Names:
Zoo
Lion
Cub 1
Cub 2
Elephant
Calf 1
Calf 2
Calf 2.1
Calf 2.2
