The Pokedex is an electronic device created and designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokemon. In this assignment you will write code to implement a small part of this fictive device.

We have provided you with the class Pokemon and the static class Pokedex. The latter has the static method PrintTotalEvolutions, which should call the method PrintEvolutionCount.

PrintTotalEvolutions
Complete the method Pokedex.PrintTotalEvolutions, so that it calls Pokedex.PrintEvolutionCount correctly.

PrintEvolutionCount
This static method takes an List<Pokemon> object and a lambda expression (Action). It recursively prints the name of each pokemon in the list and the number of evolutions it has, using the lambda expression as the print action.

Nothing is printed for a pokemon in the list with no evolutions (see the example output below). This check should be done in the recursive function itself and not in the lambda expression.

The lambda expression (Action) takes an object of class Pokemon and returns nothing.
For example:

List<Pokemon> PokemonList = new() {
    new Pokemon {
        Name = "Charmander",
        Evolutions = new List<Pokemon> {
            new Pokemon {
                Name = "Charmeleon",
                Evolutions = new List<Pokemon> {
                    new Pokemon {
                        Name = "Charizard",
                        Evolutions = new List<Pokemon> {
                            new Pokemon { Name = "Mega Charizard X" },
                            new Pokemon { Name = "Mega Charizard Y" }
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
        }
    },
    new Pokemon {
        Name = "Bulbasaur",
        Evolutions = new List<Pokemon> {
            new Pokemon {
                Name = "Ivysaur",
                Evolutions = new List<Pokemon> {
                    new Pokemon { Name = "Venusaur" }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    new Pokemon {
        Name = "Squirtle",
        Evolutions = new List<Pokemon> {
            new Pokemon {
                Name = "Wartortle",
                Evolutions = new List<Pokemon> {
                    new Pokemon { Name = "Blastoise" }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
The above code should result in the following console output:

Charmander has 1 evolutions.
Charmeleon has 1 evolutions.
Charizard has 2 evolutions.
Bulbasaur has 1 evolutions.
Ivysaur has 1 evolutions.
Squirtle has 1 evolutions.
Wartortle has 1 evolutions.
